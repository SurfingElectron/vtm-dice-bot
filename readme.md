# Vampire the Masquerade (V20) Discord bot
Description

## Commands

## Glossary
- **Difficulty:** The threshold for success 
- **Success:** A dice which equals or surpasses the difficulty
- **Botch:** A roll which has no successes, and at least 1 dice rolling 1.

## What did I learn?
- **Decorators in Python:** Not encountered these before, had to do some reading to understand what they are and what they do.

## Challenges
- **Updating Python**: I decided to move to the latest version of Python (from v3.10 to v3.11) and it caused absolute havoc! Had to do some digging for solutions, and in the end it turned out I needed to change the environment variables in Windows to the new Python install paths. Now I know for next time?

## Improvements

## Bugs

## Packages
**[dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/):** For using environment variables.
